# Modern Devs Meetup Presentation from Jan 9th, 2018
https://www.meetup.com/ModernDevsCLT/events/246054648/

This repo includes the PPT and code from the live example.

### Pre-reqs to run the example
* python 2.7 and pip (python package manager)
* Install pip packages for keras and tensorflow
```
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
```

### Run the example
```
python mnist_mlp_example.py
```

### Change values epochs, max_train_length, and neurons starting at line 20 to increase accuracy
```
epochs = 10
max_train_length = 60000
neurons = 512
```

# Resources for developers

[Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) - Geared towards developers with easy to understand use cases and a variety of different models.

### Research Papers
Search for research papers related to your use case.  Most of these papers assume that the reader is an expert on the machine learning concepts and the math they describe, but you can still find some useful info on what models people are trying for different use cases without understanding all the technical details.
